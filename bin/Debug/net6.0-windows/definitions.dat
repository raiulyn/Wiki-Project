ArrayArrayLinearbA structure representing a fixed length ordered collection of values or objects with the same typeTwo Dimension ArrayArrayLinearqA data structure consisting of cells arranged in a two-dimensional grid, much like a table with rows and columns.ListListLinear&A collection of strongly typed objectsLinked listListLinearîA linear data structure which stores element in the non-contiguous location. The elements in a linked list are linked with each other using pointersSelf-Balance TreeTree
Non-LinearúHeight-balanced binary search trees that automatically keep the height as small as possible when insertion and deletion operations are performed on the treeHeapTree
Non-Linear¶The heap is a region of memory that is used to store objects. It is called a ‚Äúheap‚Äù because it is not organized in a particular order and can be accessed randomlyBinary Search TreeTree
